# Sentiment Analysis task study on IMDB Reviews dataset

The IMDB dataset is a comprehensive collection of data related to movies, TV shows, and other entertainment media, curated by the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). It includes a wide range of information about these media, such as titles (names of movies, TV shows, and episodes), ratings, summaries, etc.

The IMDb dataset is often used in data analysis and machine learning projects due to its rich and detailed information. Researchers and developers use it for tasks, like **Sentiment Analysis**, that is **analyzing user reviews to determine the overall sentiment**. This is exactly what we are going to do in this project using neural approaches, exploiting the **LSTM neural network**.

[**An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) is a type of [**recurrent neural network (RNN)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) designed to better capture and utilize information over long sequences of data, which can span hundreds or thousands of time steps. LSTMs are particularly effective for tasks where the context of the data over time is crucial, such as language modeling, time series forecasting, and sequence classification.

Aim of the project is:
- **Dataset**
  - Exploration and preparation of the dataset to better understand its structure and label distributions.
  - Split of the dataset into training sets and test sets to evaluate the model performance.
  - Data preprocessing: cleaning reviews by removing punctuation, stop words, and other unwanted characters. Tokenizing reviews by breaking them down into  individual words or subsequences of words (e.g., n-grams).

- **LSTM Model Creation**
  - Definition of the LSTM model architecture.
  - Configuration of the model input to accept variable-length sequences (tokenized reviews).
  - Set of the model output as a single unit with an activation function appropriate for binary classification (for example, the sigmoid activation function).

- **Model Training**
  - Model inputs and outputs preparation using the training set.
  - Defininition of a loss function suitable for binary classification.
  - Optimizer usage (Adam or RMSprop) to update the model weights during training.
  - Model training for a defined number of epochs, monitoring evaluation metrics such as accuracy.
 
- **Model Evaluation**
  - Evaluation of model performance using test set.
  - Calculation of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score to evaluate model performance on Sentiment Analysis.

- **Model optimization**
  - Exploration of different model variations, such as increasing the number of layers, using regularization techniques (dropout), or using more advanced neural network structures.
  - Model hyperparameters modification, such as learning rate or word embedding size, to optimize performance.
  - Cross-validation techniques esage or best-fit hyperparameter search to find the best model configuration.

## Dataset
IMDB dataset with 50,000 movie reviews for NLP and text analytics. This is a binary sentiment classification dataset, containing substantially more data than the previous benchmark datasets. A set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews is provided for training and 25,000 for testing. Goal: Predict the number of positive and negative reviews using classification and/or deep learning algorithms.
